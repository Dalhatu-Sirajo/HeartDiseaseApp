🩺 Building an Interactive Heart Disease Dashboard using Streamlit
Heart disease remains a global health challenge. To raise awareness and demonstrate the power of interactive data visualization, I built a Streamlit dashboard that explores the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. This dashboard allows users to apply dynamic filters, interact with charts, and discover patterns in heart-related clinical data.

🔧 Tools Used
Streamlit – for building the web app

Pandas – for data loading and filtering

Seaborn & Matplotlib – for high-quality visualizations

📁 Dataset: cleve.csv
The dataset includes over 14 clinical features per patient, such as:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps), Cholesterol (chol)

Heart Disease Diagnosis (num)

The num column is used as the target indicating heart disease presence (1) or absence (0).

🧪 App Features
✅ Sidebar Filters
Users can interactively filter data by:

Gender

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure Range (trestbps)

Columns to display using a multiselect dropdown

✅ Visualizations
The app dynamically updates charts based on filters:

📊 Correlation Heatmap of selected columns

📊 Grouped Bar Chart (e.g., Chest Pain vs Heart Disease)

📊 Scatter Plot (e.g., Age vs Cholesterol)

📊 Custom Scatter Plot (user-selected axes)

🚀 How to Use the App
Clone the repo or access the app:

https://dalhatu-sirajo.streamlit.app
Use the sidebar to filter by gender, chest pain type, or blood pressure range.

Choose which columns to display in the table.

Pick a chart type from the dropdown.

Explore the insights!

🎯 What I Learned
How to build an interactive dashboard from scratch using Streamlit

Real-time data filtering and visualization

Handling clinical datasets and deriving meaningful insights

💡 Next Steps
🔍 Add SHAP explainability for model interpretation

🔐 Enable patient-specific predictions using trained ML models

🌍 Build more real-world data apps (e.g., diabetes, housing, etc.)

🔚 Conclusion
This project shows how you can turn raw data into an engaging user experience using Python and Streamlit. With just a few lines of code, it’s possible to share meaningful insights, support decision-making, and build data apps for non-technical users.
